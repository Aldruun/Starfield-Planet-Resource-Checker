# Starfield-Planet-Resource-Checker
A portable Windows tool created with WPF, to help me, and hopefully you, to find planets with certain combinations of mineable resources. In the future I might add functionality to show the rough location of the star system when hovering a system name or planet name.

Usage of the filter text field:

Type any valid symbols or names, separated by at least one space e.g. "fe he-3 dy" (without the quotes) or mix it with the resource names e.g. "iron Copper al mercury Helium".
